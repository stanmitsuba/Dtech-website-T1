<!--- Pukeatua -->
<div class="w3-row-padding w3-container w3-center main">
 <img class="w3-image Houselogo" src="Images/Pukeatua.jpg" alt="Houselogo">
 <h1 class="Pukeatua"> Hope and Unity</h1>
 <img class="w3-image Map" src="Images/PukeatuaMap.jpg" alt="Map">
 <h2 class="Pukeatua"> We proudly wear the orange of the signal fire. Our maunga is Pukeatua  (Hills of the Gods), the range running between Waiwhetu and Wainui-o-mata. 
History tells of local iwi lighting signal fires on this range, to warn others of approaching danger. This is our kaupapa, working together that we may feel safe and thrive.

<!--- Pukeariki -->
<div class="w3-row-padding w3-container w3-center header">
 <img class="w3-image Houselogo" src="Images/Pukeariki.jpg" alt="Houselogo">
 <h1 class="Pukeariki"> Growth through challange</h1>
 <img class="w3-image Map" src="Images/PukearikiMap.jpg" alt="Map">
 <h2 class="Pukeariki"> We are proud to assemble beneath the colour purple and the symbol of the nikau. Our maunga is Pukeariki, the range that defines the western margin of the Hutt Valley. The nikau starts as a small flax-like palm and grows over time into beautiful tree. This is our kaupapa, celebrating both who we are, and who we will become.

<!--- Remutaka -->
<div class="w3-row-padding w3-container w3-center main">
 <img class="w3-image Houselogo" src="Images/Remutaka.jpg" alt="Houselogo">
 <h1 class="Remutaka"> Take a risk, reach for your goals</h1>
 <img class="w3-image Map" src="Images/RemutakaMap.jpg" alt="Map">
 <h2 class="Remutaka"> We gather together beneath the cool shade of forest green and the emblem of a chief’s feather. Our maunga is Remutaka, the ranges which stand between the Hutt Valley and our Wairarapa neighbours.  Haunuiananaia, an ancestor of the Te Ati Hau a Paparangi people of the Whanganui region, left his home in southern Taranaki to explore and during his journey, he took rest in these ranges and considered his quest. This is our kaupapa, to strike out, take risks and explore the world around us.

<!--- Tararua -->
<div class="w3-row-padding w3-container w3-center header">
 <img class="w3-image Houselogo" src="Images/Tararua.jpg" alt="Houselogo">
 <h1 class="Tararua"> Strength & Unity</h1>
 <img class="w3-image Map" src="Images/TararuaMap.jpg" alt="Map">
 <h2 class="Tararua"> We stand proud beneath the white of the snow capped mountain. Our maunga is Tararua, the mighty range of peaks that stands guard over the northern end of our valley. Sir Edmond Hillary said: “It is not the mountain we conquer, but ourselves.” This is our kaupapa, looking inward to find our strength while helping those around us conquer their own personal mountains.

<!--- Orongorongo -->
<div class="w3-row-padding w3-container w3-center main">

 <h1 class="Orongorongo"> Strength in diversity</h1>
 <img class="w3-image Map" src="Images/OrongorongoMap.jpg" alt="Map">
 <h2 class="Orongorongo"> We meet beneath the pink of the evening sky, bathing the pohutukawa lined Orongorongo valley in its gentle light. This awa, which runs through the southern Remutaka ranges, is a shapeshifter, one day a gentle trickle, the next a raging torrent. We derive our kaupapa from this image. It is in our diversity that we find our strength.

 <h1 class="Matairangi"> Protect and serve</h1>
 <img class="w3-image Map" src="Images/MatairangiMap.jpg" alt="Map">
<h2 class="Matairangi"> We wear the joyous yellow of the kowhai. Our maunga is Matairangi, the southern peak which can be seen from our school field. This is the point where the bird spirit of the taniwha Whataitai alighted after his death. There it watched over the harbour below and this is our kaupapa, to keep watch over the needs of others, to serve and protect.
