<h2>Houses</h2>

<h3>There are six Houses at HVHS, each named after a prominent Wellington maunga or mountain peak or landmark. House groups are made up of students from Year 9 to 13. Each house has 2 student leaders.</h3>

<h3>Houses compete against each other in a range of activities throughout the year; sports, cultural, creative and service activities. Students can also gain House points through their Attitude to Learning grades each term. Students compete for this beautiful trophy. The waka was designed and carved by Terry Deverell, a former staff member.</h3>
